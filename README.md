# CC98Lite
A client used in iPhone for access of CC98 Forum

CC98Lite is a project aiming to provide a convenient client for users in Zhejiang
University to access CC98 forum by iPhone. During the development I have got lots 
of help from another similar open-source project named "MyCC98", but CC98Lite will
give you different user experience, which therefore deserves your attention. 

CC98Lite is my first iOS project, which took me nearly one month to develop its 
main function. In future I will continue to optimize its performance, add detailed 
documents, and refactor bad design in it. 

Now I decide to publish the sourcecode of CC98Lite with MIT license:
